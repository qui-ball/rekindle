# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-10-21 09:43
**Slug:** runpod-serverless

## User's Request

Right now my backend is assuming a single runpod pod to run the restore workflow. I want to try runpod's serverless (look up the docs online). Please help me update the backend to support runpod serverless.

## Context

The user wants to migrate from RunPod's pod-based architecture to their serverless offering for running image restoration workflows.
