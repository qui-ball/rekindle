## User Request
Help me implement an API call in the backend to my local ComfyUI server. I have a Python script called run_restore.py and the corresponding ComfyUI JSON API file called restore.json. I want you to put them in the correct dir structure, and integrate them in the backend.

## Context
- User has existing Python script: `run_restore.py`
- User has ComfyUI workflow JSON: `restore.json`
- Need to integrate with existing backend
- ComfyUI server is running locally
