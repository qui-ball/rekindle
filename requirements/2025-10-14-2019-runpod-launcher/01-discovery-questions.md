# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Will this RunPod pod launcher be used to automatically scale AI processing workloads?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (RunPod is typically used for auto-scaling AI workloads, and your architecture docs mention RunPod as the primary AI processing service)

## Q2: Should the launched pods use existing network volumes that are already created?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (reusing network volumes is more efficient and cost-effective for persistent data like models)

## Q3: Will this Python script be integrated into the existing FastAPI backend and Celery task system?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (integrating with existing backend allows automated pod management tied to job processing)

## Q4: Do you want the script to also handle pod lifecycle management (stopping/deleting pods when idle)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (proper lifecycle management prevents runaway costs and is essential for serverless-style workloads)

## Q5: Should the script support launching multiple pod configurations (different GPU types, templates, etc.)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (flexibility to choose appropriate GPU types based on workload requirements)
