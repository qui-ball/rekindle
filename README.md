## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd rekindle
   ```

2. **One-time setup for HTTPS (required for mobile camera testing):**
   ```bash
   brew install mkcert
   mkcert -install
   ```

3. **Start the development environment:**
   ```bash
   ./dev
   ```

   This will:
