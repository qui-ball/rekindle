Restores, colours, and animates
Mobile and web app
Family tree management feature
Very expensive apparently

-----

Webapp but primarily focus on mobile users?
Think about how to get old, printed photos into the app
Definitely take a photo of the photo
This is where restoration comes in, not just for restoring the old photo, but also fix the picture of a picture

Watermark could be a nice frame with our product name and logo, instead of annoying traditional watermark

Definitely ephemeral storage for free users, might consider long term storage for paid
