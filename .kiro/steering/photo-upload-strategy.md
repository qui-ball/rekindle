```

**Pre-upload Flow:**
```
1. Image displayed full screen
2. Rectangular cropping overlay with draggable corner/edge points
3. User adjusts cropping as desired
4. "Upload" button → File size detection → Resolution optimization → Upload
```

**Post-upload Flow:**
```
1. Perspective correction (automatic skew fix)
2. Initial quality enhancements (automatic preprocessing)
3. Save processing-ready image
4. Generate thumbnail for performance
5. Delete original upload
6. Ready for AI processing
```

#### **Mobile-First Approach**
- **Camera as Primary:** Default to camera capture on mobile
