# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Photo Management System enables users to view, organize, and manage all their processed photos while providing intuitive controls for selecting processing actions (restoration, colourization, animation, and future features). This system serves as the central hub for users to interact with their photo collection, manage their credit usage, and initiate new processing jobs.

The system directly supports our core mission of "bringing memories to life" by providing users with easy access to their photo collection and flexible processing options, while maintaining the emotional connection that drives our target demographic (30-60 year old families).
