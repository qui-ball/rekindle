# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Photo Upload System is the foundational feature that enables users to easily submit their precious family photos for AI restoration and colourization. This system must accommodate our target demographic (30-60 year old families) by providing intuitive, accessible upload methods across multiple platforms and scenarios. The system serves as the entry point for all user interactions and must handle various photo sources including physical photos, mobile device galleries, and desktop files.

The upload system directly supports our core mission of "bringing memories to life" by removing friction from the photo submission process, especially for older family photos that may exist in various formats and locations.

## Requirements

3. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL fill the entire screen without any aspect ratio constraints, padding, or letterboxing in any orientation
4. WHEN the camera is active in portrait mode THEN the capture area SHALL remain fixed at the top portion of the screen (similar to native camera apps)
5. WHEN the camera is active in landscape mode THEN the capture area SHALL remain fixed on the left portion of the screen with the same dimensions as portrait mode
6. WHEN the camera is initialized THEN the system SHALL request the highest available resolution from the device camera
7. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL use the device's native camera resolution without downscaling or compression
8. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL display real-time lighting and focus quality indicators positioned outside the main capture area
9. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL position UI controls appropriately for both portrait and landscape orientations without overlapping the main capture area
10. WHEN a photo is captured THEN the system SHALL capture at full device resolution and proceed directly to intelligent cropping
11. WHEN the user adjusts the crop area THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview with corner handle manipulation
12. IF the photo quality is poor due to lighting or focus THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback before capture

### Requirement 2

4. WHEN a photo is captured and processed on mobile THEN the desktop SHALL automatically display the upload progress
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN both desktop and mobile SHALL show the successful upload confirmation
6. IF the QR code expires THEN the system SHALL generate a new code automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As any user uploading a photo, I want to see clear progress feedback and status updates so that I understand what's happening with my upload and feel confident the process is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file upload begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar with percentage completion
2. WHEN upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL show estimated time remaining
3. WHEN upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a clear success message
4. WHEN preprocessing begins THEN the system SHALL indicate "Preparing your photo for processing"
5. WHEN the photo is queued for AI processing THEN the system SHALL confirm "Photo ready for restoration"
6. IF an error occurs during upload THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with various photo formats and sizes, I want the system to handle my files appropriately so that I can upload photos regardless of their original format or size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL validate it supports JPG, PNG, HEIC, and WebP formats
