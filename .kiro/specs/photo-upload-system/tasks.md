## Task Details

### Task 5.1: JScanify Integration for Professional Smart Cropping
**Priority**: High (core feature for 98%+ accuracy requirement)
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 4.4 (Camera capture flow)

**Detailed Requirements:**

**JScanify Integration:**
- **Library**: JScanify (MIT license, built on OpenCV.js) for professional document/photo edge detection
- **OpenCV.js**: ~8-10MB dependency, loaded asynchronously during app initialization
- **Accuracy**: 95-98% detection accuracy for well-lit photos with clear edges
- **Processing time**: 0.5-2 seconds on modern mobile devices, 2-4 seconds on older devices

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Replace existing basic PhotoDetector with JScanify-powered SmartPhotoDetector
- Implement app-level preloading of OpenCV.js to avoid delays during photo capture
- Create graceful fallback system when JScanify fails to load or detect edges
- Add confidence scoring to determine when to use smart detection vs. generic crop area
- Integrate with existing QuadrilateralCropper for manual adjustment capability

**Performance Optimization:**
- Load OpenCV.js during app initialization with loading screen (one-time 2-5 second delay)
- Cache OpenCV.js in browser for instant subsequent app loads
- Show processing indicator during 0.5-2 second edge detection phase
- Implement progressive enhancement: generic crop first, then smart detection overlay

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JScanify loads successfully during app initialization with proper error handling
- Edge detection achieves 95%+ accuracy for well-lit photos with clear boundaries
- Processing completes within 2 seconds on modern devices, 4 seconds on older devices
- Graceful fallback to generic crop area when detection fails or confidence is low
- Seamless integration with existing quadrilateral cropper interface
- No delays during photo capture (processing happens after capture)
- Proper error handling and user feedback for all failure scenarios

### Task 5.2: App Initialization and OpenCV.js Preloading
**Priority**: High (required for seamless user experience)
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**: None

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Create app-level initialization service to preload OpenCV.js during startup
- Implement loading screen with progress indicator and user-friendly messaging
- Add initialization state management (loading/ready/fallback)
- Handle OpenCV.js loading failures with graceful degradation to basic cropping
- Cache OpenCV.js for instant loading on subsequent app visits
- Add timeout handling for slow network connections

**User Experience:**
- Show "Preparing smart photo detection..." message during initial load
- Display progress indicator for OpenCV.js download
- Provide "This happens once" reassurance message
- Gracefully handle loading failures without breaking app functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- OpenCV.js loads successfully during app startup with proper progress indication
- Loading screen provides clear feedback and doesn't feel broken
- App functions normally even if OpenCV.js fails to load
- Subsequent app visits are instant (cached OpenCV.js)
- Proper error handling for network failures and timeouts

### Task 5.3: QuadrilateralCropper Enhancement for JScanify Integration
**Priority**: High (maintains manual adjustment capability)
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 5.1 (JScanify integration)

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Modify existing QuadrilateralCropper to accept JScanify corner point format
- Convert JScanify corner points to quadrilateral coordinates for existing UI
- Maintain all existing functionality: circular draggable corners, touch support, grid overlay
- Add confidence indicator to show detection quality to users
- Ensure seamless transition between automatic detection and manual adjustment

**JScanify Corner Point Integration:**
- JScanify returns corner points in format: `{topLeftCorner, topRightCorner, bottomLeftCorner, bottomRightCorner}`
- Convert to existing QuadrilateralArea format for UI consistency
- Handle coordinate system differences between JScanify and display coordinates
- Maintain existing scaling and positioning logic for different image sizes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JScanify corner points display correctly in existing quadrilateral interface
- All existing manual adjustment functionality continues to work
- Smooth transition from automatic detection to manual refinement
- Confidence indicator provides useful feedback to users
- No regression in existing cropper performance or usability

### Key Implementation Notes

**Perspective Correction (Task 10.1-A):**
- Use OpenCV.js (already loaded for JScanify)
- Target: <1 second processing time
- Graceful fallback to original image on error
- See design.md for complete code examples

**Smart Cropping Improvements (Tasks 5.6-5.8):**
- Tier 1 (Task 5.6): Enhanced preprocessing (+15-20% accuracy)
- Tier 2 (Task 5.7): Multi-pass detection (+20-25% accuracy)
- Tier 3 (Task 5.8): Adaptive strategy (performance optimization)
- See design.md for detection strategies and confidence scoring
