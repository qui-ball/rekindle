# PWA Camera Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical PWA camera functionality issues that must be resolved to determine if PWA can provide a native-app-like experience for photo capture. The primary goal is to achieve native camera app quality and behavior, including proper rotation handling, maximum camera resolution, and seamless Docker HTTPS development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Docker HTTPS Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the PWA in Docker with HTTPS support so that I can test camera functionality on mobile devices during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `./dev https` THEN the system SHALL launch Docker containers with HTTPS enabled
2. WHEN the HTTPS server starts THEN it SHALL generate valid local certificates for localhost and local IP
3. WHEN accessing the app from mobile devices THEN the HTTPS connection SHALL work without certificate errors
4. WHEN the Docker container runs THEN it SHALL support hot reload for development changes
5. WHEN certificates expire THEN the system SHALL automatically regenerate them

### Requirement 2: Camera Rotation and Orientation Handling

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the camera to work properly in all orientations so that I can capture photos naturally regardless of how I hold my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I rotate my device to landscape THEN the camera interface SHALL adapt to landscape layout
2. WHEN I rotate my device to portrait THEN the camera interface SHALL adapt to portrait layout
3. WHEN the orientation changes THEN the camera stream SHALL maintain proper aspect ratio without distortion
4. WHEN capturing in landscape THEN the photo SHALL be saved in correct orientation
5. WHEN capturing in portrait THEN the photo SHALL be saved in correct orientation
6. WHEN the device auto-rotates THEN the UI controls SHALL reposition appropriately
7. WHEN using iOS devices THEN orientation changes SHALL work without browser refresh

### Requirement 3: Native Camera Quality Matching

**User Story:** As a user, I want PWA camera quality to match native camera apps so that my photos are as clear and detailed as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting camera access THEN the system SHALL request maximum available resolution
2. WHEN capturing photos THEN the image quality SHALL be at least 1080p on capable devices
3. WHEN comparing PWA photos to native camera THEN the quality difference SHALL be minimal (<10% quality loss)
4. WHEN capturing HEIC photos on iOS THEN they SHALL convert to high-quality JPEG (0.95 quality)
5. WHEN using back camera THEN it SHALL default to highest resolution mode
6. WHEN capturing photos THEN there SHALL be no additional compression beyond necessary format conversion

### Requirement 4: PWA vs Native App Decision Framework

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want clear metrics on PWA camera performance so that I can decide whether to proceed with PWA or develop native apps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing camera functionality THEN the system SHALL measure and report camera resolution achieved
2. WHEN testing across devices THEN the system SHALL document compatibility across iOS and Android
3. WHEN comparing user experience THEN the system SHALL measure capture time and responsiveness
4. WHEN evaluating PWA limitations THEN the system SHALL document any features unavailable in PWA
5. WHEN testing offline capability THEN the system SHALL verify camera works without internet connection

### Requirement 5: Advanced Camera Features Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced camera features to work in PWA so that the experience feels native and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using camera THEN focus and exposure SHALL adjust automatically
2. WHEN lighting conditions change THEN the camera SHALL adapt exposure appropriately
3. WHEN capturing photos THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for capture success
4. WHEN using front camera THEN it SHALL switch seamlessly from back camera
5. WHEN camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL provide clear recovery instructions

### Requirement 6: Performance and Memory Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the camera to work smoothly without draining battery or causing performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using camera for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
2. WHEN capturing multiple photos THEN performance SHALL not degrade
3. WHEN running on older devices THEN the camera SHALL still function acceptably
4. WHEN switching between camera and other features THEN transitions SHALL be smooth
5. WHEN camera is not in use THEN it SHALL release resources properly

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the camera to work consistently so that all users have the same quality experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using iOS Safari THEN camera functionality SHALL work without limitations
2. WHEN using Android Chrome THEN camera functionality SHALL work without limitations
3. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the interface SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN using different camera hardware THEN the system SHALL utilize available capabilities
5. WHEN testing on various devices THEN compatibility issues SHALL be documented and addressed

### Requirement 8: Development and Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing tools so that I can validate PWA camera functionality across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL include automated camera permission testing
2. WHEN testing camera capture THEN the system SHALL validate image quality and format
3. WHEN testing orientation changes THEN the system SHALL verify UI adaptation
4. WHEN testing on real devices THEN the system SHALL provide remote debugging capabilities
5. WHEN deploying changes THEN the system SHALL automatically test camera functionality
