# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Photo Processing Pipeline is the core AI-powered system that transforms uploaded family photos through restoration and colourization services. This system handles the complete workflow from receiving uploaded photos to delivering processed results, managing job queues, integrating with RunPod AI services, and providing real-time status updates to users.

The pipeline supports our credit-based business model by enforcing user tier limitations, tracking processing costs, and managing priority queues. It serves as the heart of our "bring memories to life" mission by delivering professional-grade AI processing at consumer-friendly prices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has uploaded a photo, I want to select my processing options (restoration, colourization, or both) so that I can get the specific enhancements I need for my family memories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes photo upload THEN the system SHALL present processing options: restoration (2 credits), colourization (3 credits), or combined (4 credits)
2. WHEN a user selects processing options THEN the system SHALL display the credit cost and confirm sufficient credits are available
3. WHEN a user confirms processing THEN the system SHALL deduct the appropriate credits from their account atomically
4. WHEN processing options are selected THEN the system SHALL queue the job with the correct priority based on user tier
5. IF a user has insufficient credits THEN the system SHALL display upgrade options and prevent job submission
6. WHEN a user selects combined processing THEN the system SHALL apply the 1-credit discount automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a free tier user, I want my photos processed at 480p resolution so that I can try the service while understanding the quality limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a free tier user submits a photo THEN the system SHALL automatically resize the image to 480p maximum resolution
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL add a small watermark to the processed result
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL store the result with 7-day expiration
4. WHEN a free tier job is queued THEN the system SHALL place it in the standard priority queue
5. IF the free tier daily limit is reached THEN the system SHALL queue jobs for next-day processing
6. WHEN a free tier user views results THEN the system SHALL display upgrade prompts for higher quality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a paid tier user, I want my photos processed at 720p HD resolution with priority processing so that I receive high-quality results quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a paid tier user submits a photo THEN the system SHALL process at 720p maximum resolution
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL not add any watermarks to the result
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL store the result permanently
4. WHEN a paid tier job is queued THEN the system SHALL place it in the priority queue ahead of free tier jobs
5. WHEN multiple paid tier jobs are queued THEN the system SHALL process "Forever" tier before "Cherish" before "Remember"
6. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry without deducting additional credits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user waiting for my photo to be processed, I want real-time status updates so that I know the progress and estimated completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job is queued THEN the system SHALL display "Queued for processing" with estimated wait time
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL update status to "Processing your photo" with progress indicator
3. WHEN processing is 50% complete THEN the system SHALL update to show "Applying AI enhancements"
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL immediately notify the user and display the result
5. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error message and offer retry options
6. WHEN queue position changes THEN the system SHALL update estimated wait time in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As the system administrator, I want automatic job retry and error handling so that temporary failures don't result in lost credits or poor user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a RunPod API call fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN all retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL refund the user's credits and log the failure
3. WHEN a job exceeds maximum processing time THEN the system SHALL cancel it and refund credits
4. WHEN RunPod service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue jobs for later processing without charging credits
5. IF a processed result is corrupted THEN the system SHALL automatically reprocess without additional credit charge
6. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators and provide user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and download my processed photos easily so that I can save and share my restored family memories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate a thumbnail for quick preview
2. WHEN a user views results THEN the system SHALL display before/after comparison with zoom capability
3. WHEN a user downloads a photo THEN the system SHALL provide the full resolution processed image
4. WHEN a user shares a result THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable link with appropriate permissions
5. IF a user's storage limit is reached THEN the system SHALL prompt to delete old results or upgrade tier
6. WHEN a free tier result expires THEN the system SHALL notify the user 24 hours before deletion

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want accurate cost tracking and usage analytics so that I can monitor profitability and optimize pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job is processed THEN the system SHALL record the actual RunPod cost and processing time
2. WHEN daily reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include total costs, revenue, and profit margins
3. WHEN usage patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL track popular processing types and user tier distribution
4. WHEN cost thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL send alerts to prevent budget overruns
5. IF processing costs spike unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cost controls
6. WHEN monthly reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed cost breakdowns by service type

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user concerned about my photo privacy, I want assurance that my photos are processed securely and deleted appropriately so that my personal memories remain private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos are sent to RunPod THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections and secure API keys
2. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL immediately delete the photo from RunPod servers
3. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL remove all associated photos and results within 24 hours
4. WHEN photos are stored THEN the system SHALL use encrypted S3 storage with user-specific access controls
5. IF a data breach is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately notify affected users and authorities
6. WHEN audit logs are maintained THEN the system SHALL track all photo access and processing activities

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system that needs to scale, I want efficient queue management and load balancing so that processing remains fast even during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queue length exceeds capacity THEN the system SHALL automatically scale RunPod workers
2. WHEN processing demand is low THEN the system SHALL reduce active workers to minimize costs
3. WHEN multiple jobs are queued THEN the system SHALL distribute them across available workers efficiently
4. WHEN a worker fails THEN the system SHALL automatically reassign jobs to healthy workers
5. IF queue wait times exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and consider emergency scaling
6. WHEN peak hours are detected THEN the system SHALL proactively scale resources to maintain performance
