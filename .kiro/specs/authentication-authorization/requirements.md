# Authentication & Authorization - Requirements

## Document Info

**Created:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** Approved  
**Decision:** Auth0 (25,000 MAU free tier confirmed)  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical for MVP launch

---

## Executive Summary

Implement user authentication and authorization system using Auth0 to enable:
- User registration and login (email/password + social)
- Session management with JWT tokens
- Tier-based access control (Free, Remember, Cherish, Forever)
- Credit-based feature gating
- User profile and account management

**Key Decision:** Auth0 selected over Clerk, AWS Cognito, Supabase
- **Reason:** 25,000 MAU free tier covers entire MVP phase ($0 cost)
- **Trade-off:** 5-7 day implementation vs 2-3 days (Clerk)
- **Benefit:** Trusted brand for 30-60 y/o demographic, enterprise security

- **Probability:** Low (99.9% SLA)
- **Mitigation:** Queue requests, clear error messages, status page

### Risk 2: Auth0 Cost Overrun
- **Impact:** Unexpected costs if exceeding 25K MAU
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Monitor MAU daily, alerts at 20K, plan for upgrade

### Risk 3: Security Vulnerability
- **Impact:** User data breach
- **Probability:** Low (using Auth0)
- **Mitigation:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, monitoring

### Risk 4: Complex Setup
- **Impact:** Delayed launch
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** 5-7 day buffer, Auth0 documentation, community support

### Risk 5: User Adoption
- **Impact:** Low signups
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Prominent social login, simple flow, clear value prop

## Open Questions

1. ✅ **RESOLVED:** Auth0 free tier limit? **Answer:** 25,000 MAU confirmed
2. **PENDING:** Should we implement MFA in MVP or defer to Phase 2?
3. **PENDING:** What login methods to prioritize? (Email first? Social first?)
4. **PENDING:** Account deletion: immediate or grace period? **Recommendation:** 30-day grace
5. **PENDING:** Session timeout: 7 days or 30 days inactivity?
